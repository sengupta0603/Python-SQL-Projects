# Automated Churn Analysis with AWS

This project automates customer churn analysis using AWS cloud services, optimizing performance, reducing manual effort, and delivering real-time insights to drive customer retention. By integrating Apache Airflow for workflow orchestration, API Gateway for streamlined data ingestion, and Amazon QuickSight for real-time visualization, the solution significantly enhances data processing efficiency and retention strategy outcomes.

## Project Overview

The telecom industry typically experiences a monthly churn rate of 5–8%, translating into a potential annual revenue loss of $500,000 for every 1% increase in churn. Furthermore, over 60% of the company’s data processing was previously manual, resulting in a 30–40% delay in churn analysis.

To address these challenges, this project delivers an AWS-based automated solution to:
- Eliminate manual processing bottlenecks
- Enable real-time, data-driven churn analysis
- Empower the business with proactive customer retention strategies

## Solution Architecture

1. **Data Ingestion**
   - Customer data is sent via API Gateway and securely stored in Amazon S3.
2. **ETL Processing**
   - Apache Airflow triggers AWS Glue jobs to extract, transform, and load data into Amazon Redshift.
3. **Real-Time Analytics**
   - Once loaded, Amazon QuickSight connects to Redshift to provide interactive dashboards and real-time churn analysis.
4. **Workflow Monitoring**
   - Airflow oversees the entire workflow, ensuring seamless task execution and alerting on any failures.
