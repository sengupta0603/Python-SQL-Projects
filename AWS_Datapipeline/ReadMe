**Automated Churn Analysis with AWS**
This project automates customer churn analysis using AWS services to optimize performance, reduce manual processing, and deliver real-time insights into customer retention. 
By leveraging Apache Airflow for workflow orchestration, data ingestion through API Gateway, and real-time visualization with Amazon QuickSight, we significantly improved data processing efficiency and customer retention outcomes.

**Project Overview**
The telecom industry faces a high monthly churn rate of 5-8%, which translates into a potential $500,000 annual revenue loss for every 1% increase in churn. 
Additionally, over 60% of the company’s data processing is manual, leading to delays in churn analysis by 30-40%. To address these challenges, 
I developed an AWS-based solution to automate data processing, enhance real-time insights, and enable proactive customer retention strategies.

**Key Features:**
Automated data ingestion through API Gateway.
Triggered AWS Glue jobs for ETL processes.
Data stored and processed in Amazon Redshift.
Real-time customer insights provided via Amazon QuickSight.
Workflow orchestration and monitoring using Apache Airflow.

**Technologies Used:**
AWS API Gateway – for seamless data ingestion.
AWS Glue – for ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) operations.
Amazon S3 – for data storage.
Amazon Redshift – for efficient data warehousing and analysis.
Amazon QuickSight – for real-time data visualization.
Apache Airflow – for task automation and workflow management.

**Project Results:**
Reduced manual data processing by 60%.
Improved churn analysis speed by 40%.
Prevented a potential 5-10% monthly loss of at-risk customers with real-time insights.

**How It Works:**
Data Ingestion: Data is ingested through API Gateway and stored in Amazon S3.
ETL Process: Airflow triggers a Glue job to extract, transform, and load the data into Amazon Redshift.
Real-Time Insights: Once the data is loaded, Amazon QuickSight provides real-time analysis and visualizations on customer churn patterns.
Monitoring: Airflow manages the workflow, ensuring tasks are completed in sequence and monitoring the successful transfer of data.
